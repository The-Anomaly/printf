NAME
	_printf

SYNOPSIS
	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf() produces output according to the format below.
	The function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.

Format of the format string
    
       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
       its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
       of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
       are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
       specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
       subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
       introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
       specifier.
